## 🎯 **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

### 1. **Extensive Testing** 🧪
**Objective**: Validate the refactored system with diverse document types

**Tasks**:
- Test with various PDF formats (scanned, text-based, mixed content)
- Validate with different document languages (English, Spanish, French, German)
- Test coordinate extraction accuracy with known reference documents
- Verify address inference quality across different document types
- Test edge cases (very large documents, corrupted files, unusual formats)

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Identify any remaining bugs or inconsistencies
- Establish baseline performance metrics
- Document optimal settings for different document types
- Create test suite for regression testing
